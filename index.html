                field as a nurse and later transitioning into x-ray technology. The daily exposure to technology and witnessing its profound impact on patient health sparked an interest for diving deeper
                into the intricacies of computer programs and hardware. My passion lies in continuously seeking new knowledge and skills, helping others, and embracing the transformative power 
                of technology in everyday life.</p>
